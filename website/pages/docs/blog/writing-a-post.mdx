# Writing a post

You can write MDX exactly the same way you do with documentation

There are also additional options you should pass to the front matter:

-   name
-   date
-   description

The `name` option will be the main `title` of you post page and the `date` option will be positioned below, in a pretty and simple layout

These details are also used by the `BlogPosts` component to show a grid of all your posts

```md
---
name: Example post
date: 25 June, 2020
description: An example post made just to test the dokz blog feature
---

## Blog post content...
```

> Notice the space between the exports, MDX parse seems to have a bug with exports that have not at least 1 line of space between them

## Adding SEO

You can use the package `next-seo` to easily add SEO tags to any nextjs page

```md
---
name: Example post
date: 25 June, 2020
description: An example post made just to test the dokz blog feature
---

import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo'

<NextSeo title='Title' description='A short description goes here.' />

## My content...
```
