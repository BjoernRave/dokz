# Writing a post

You can write MDX exactly the same way you do with documentation

There are also additional options you should pass that are `title` and `date`:

```md
export const title = 'My first blog post'

export const date = '24 June, 2020'

Blog post content...
```

> Notice the space between the exports, MDX parse seems to have a bug with exports that have not at least 1 line of space between them

## Adding SEO

You can use the package `next-seo` to easily add SEO tags to any nextjs page

```jsx
import { NextSeo } from 'next-seo'

export const title = 'My first blog post'

export const date = '24 June, 2020'

<NextSeo title={title} description='A short description goes here.' />

My content...
```
