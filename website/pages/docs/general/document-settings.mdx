# Document settings

Document settings (or also called front matter) provide a way to enrich documents with metadata used to generate your documentation site.

They are defined at the top of the `.mdx` file, use YAML and can be used to customize your pages by passing this data to your theme.

```markdown
---
name: My Document
---

# Other stuff

Minim magna in veniam Lorem adipisicing deserunt.
```

Document settings Dokz uses are:

-   `name` The name of your document, used for the link in the sidebar
