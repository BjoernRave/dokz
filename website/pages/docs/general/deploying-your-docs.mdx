# Deploy your site

Dokz uses Next.js under the hood so you can use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to deploy your application in seconds, simply run

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

The deployed site will be completely static, which means awesome performance and global availability through a CDN.
